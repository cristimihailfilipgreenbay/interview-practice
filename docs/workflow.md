# Workflow

The end-to-end flow through the app, from setting up a mock interview to seeing the
result. See [`overview.md`](./overview.md) for pages/layout, [`domain-model.md`](./domain-model.md)
for the fields referenced below, and [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) for how each
step is implemented.

## 1. Create Interview

- **Standalone, or a stage of an existing pipeline** — the candidate can start a fully
  standalone Interview, or add the next stage to an existing `JobApplication` (e.g. "Acme
  Corp — Senior Software Engineer"). Picking an existing Application pre-fills
  `company_name`/`job_title`/documents below from it, so they don't need re-entering per
  stage; a brand-new Application can also be created inline by just filling those fields
  as normal.
- **Job title** — free text; phase 1 also infers the role's domain from it (and the JD/CV).
- **Company name** — free text, optional, independent of the job description upload below.
  Without it, the interviewer would have no company identity to reference whenever the JD
  is skipped — real interviews near-universally test whether the candidate researched the
  company ("what do you know about us", "why do you want to work here").
- **Seniority** — e.g. junior / mid / senior.
- **Difficulty** — easy / medium / hard. A preset that seeds `target_question_count`,
  `tone`, `interview_type`, `response_style`, `coaching_helpers_enabled` (on for easy only) and question complexity — each independently editable afterward, and `difficulty`
  itself is still passed to the question-plan prompt as its own signal, not discarded once
  other fields are tweaked.
- **Response style** — concise / detailed. Shapes the live interviewer's phrasing and the
  evaluation write-up's length/depth.
- **Interview type** — technical / behavioral. Skews the question plan and which half
  (technical or behavioral) of the evaluation rubric is weighted more heavily at
  evaluation time.
- **Interviewer role** — `recruiter` / `technical_screener` / `hr` / `hiring_manager`, shown
  as a radio group ordered to mirror the real-world pipeline sequence (one Interview only
  ever represents a single stage, not the whole pipeline). Picking a role re-applies a
  default `interview_type` and `tone` (even overwriting a prior manual edit on those two —
  see `domain-model.md`'s default-cascade table), both still independently editable again
  afterward. Also shapes the generated persona's knowledge scope/backstory and which
  ask-back questions make sense to suggest later.
- **Job description** — select a previously saved one, or upload a new PDF by
  clicking or dropping it on a dropzone (PDF only). The upload happens immediately when the
  file is picked (parsed server-side, so a bad PDF is reported right there). The uploaded
  file then replaces the select and dropzone with an attachment (with a remove button) and
  a "save for later" checkbox, checked by default for a CV or cover letter and unchecked for a
  job description (usually specific to one role); the form holds only the returned
  Document id. Right after an upload the Document is analysed (the attachment shows an
  "Analyzing document…" indicator, and Start stays disabled meanwhile); removing the
  attachment stops it and deletes the Document. If the Document itself is rejected it is
  deleted and the candidate is told to use a different file; if the failure is on our side
  (provider unavailable, timeout) it is kept, with a notice, and analysed again when the
  interview is created. Saved Documents were already
  analysed when uploaded. Optional.
- **CV** and **cover letter** — two separate fields, each with the same
  select-existing-or-dropzone-upload pattern as job description. Both optional.
- **Interview helpers** toggle — boolean, default `false`. When on, each Q&A-phase question
  comes with a coaching-hint card grounded in the CV/cover letter where a real match
  exists, falling back to a generic hint when there's no document or no grounded match —
  the hint prompt must never fabricate experience the candidate didn't actually provide.
- **Advanced settings** (collapsed, nice to have) — per-phase overrides for model
  (`gpt-5-mini`/`gpt-5-nano`/`gpt-4o-mini`/`typesafe/jev-1.13`), temperature, max tokens, and reasoning effort,
  for any of the 5 phases individually; anything left unset falls back to the global
  Preferences default.

Submitting runs the JD/CV analysis and question-plan/persona-generation phases (which also
produces the structured technical + behavioral evaluation rubric), generates and stores the
interviewer's persona portrait image, creates the Interview record, and redirects the
candidate into the session.

## 2. Interview Session — Q&A phase

The interviewer asks questions toward the difficulty-derived target count, but can end the
phase early once it judges it has enough signal. Each interviewer question is read aloud
via text-to-speech, so it genuinely feels asked rather than just displayed. If interview
helpers are enabled, each question also comes with its coaching-hint card. The candidate
can optionally reply by voice instead of typing (nice to have). A right-side interviewer
sidebar shows the persona's portrait/name alongside an **Abandon interview** action — the
candidate can quit at any point instead; the session is then marked abandoned rather than
completed.

## 3. Interview Session — ask-back phase

Always offered once the Q&A phase ends: the candidate can ask the interviewer their own
questions (with optional AI-suggested questions, tailored to the interviewer's role, that
they can accept, edit, or ignore), or decline entirely. What they ask — or that they
decline — is itself a signal that feeds into the evaluation, the way it would in a real
interview.

## 4. Evaluation

Once the session ends (completed or abandoned), `gpt-5-mini` (the same model that ran the
interview) produces a STAR-based evaluation over the full transcript (both phases): a
verdict, reasoning, and improvement suggestions, graded against the rubric generated back
at creation. Separately, a dev-facing **Interviewer Performance Review** judges how well
the AI interviewer itself performed (question quality, persona consistency, pacing) using a
different, independent judge model.

## 5. Results

Shows the verdict, reasoning, improvement areas, the full transcript, and the interviewer's
persona image. Any past interview remains reachable from the history sidebar and re-opens
straight into its Results page.
