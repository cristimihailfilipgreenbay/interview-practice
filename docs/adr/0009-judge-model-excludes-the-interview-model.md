# Judge model can't collide with the model it's judging

`InterviewerReview.judge_model` must differ from whichever model actually produced
phase 2 (question-plan/persona generation) and phase 3 (live interviewer conversation) for
that Interview — the two phases whose output constitutes "the interviewer" being judged.
Without this, the narrower per-interview judge choices
(`google/gemini-2.5-flash`/`gpt-5-mini`/`gpt-5-nano`/`typesafe/jev-1.13`) overlap with the Interview model
choices (`gpt-5-mini`/`gpt-5-nano`/`gpt-4o-mini`/`typesafe/jev-1.13`), so a candidate could otherwise pick the same
model for both roles and quietly defeat the whole reason `InterviewerReview` is decoupled
from `gpt-5-mini` in the first place (see [ADR 0003](./0003-self-grading-evaluation-vs-decoupled-interviewer-review.md)).
Enforced by excluding the colliding model from the judge-model picker everywhere it
appears (Preferences, per-interview advanced settings), with a backend validation check as
a safety net for anything that bypasses the UI (`app/interviews/model_rules.py`, raising
`409 JUDGE_MODEL_COLLISION`).
